#### Description
Cryptofolio: My CS50 2024 Final Project.
Cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges makes it challenging to track performance in a unified way. With coins often distributed across different exchanges and wallets, keeping track of them all can be confusing and may lead to missed opportunities.
I aimed to create an app to simplify tracking of cryptocurrencies across various platforms by aggregating data and providing real-time insights.<br>
For that reason, one can create multiple independent portfolios and add transactions to them. The app keeps track of profits and losses on a currency, portfolio, and user level.<br>
The app was built using Python, Flask, Jinja, JS, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. Additionally, Bootstrap for responsive design, the login_required decorator to secure access, and SQL wrapper introduced during the CS50 course.
While the initial version focuses on core functionality, future enhancements will include:
* Handling of various APIs and their keys to import data from exchanges.
* Blockchain integration to track non-exchange assets.
* The ability to conduct transactions right from the app.

These features will be part of future development, enhancing Cryptofolio's value beyond CS50.

#### Challenges and Learning Outcomes
Effective project planning is crucial, yet even the most meticulously crafted plans can face unexpected hurdles. During the development of Cryptofolio, I encountered several challenges that required flexibility and quick problem-solving. External commitments often competed for my time and attention, requiring a balance between maintaining momentum on the project and fulfilling other responsibilities.<br>
Despite these challenges, this project has been an invaluable learning experience. I gained deeper insights into integrating different technologies, handling real-time data, and designing a user-centric application. I also learned to adapt my approach, troubleshoot unforeseen issues efficiently, and remain committed to continuous improvement.<br>
This project reinforced the importance of resilience and iterative progress. While the current version provides a solid foundation, I am eager to enhance and expand Cryptofolio as opportunities arise.

A notable technical challenge I faced was dealing with very small floating-point numbers. Tiny discrepancies can affect trust and insights. These small floats caused unexpected rounding errors or cluttered the user interface.<br>
To address this, I enhanced numerical precision in Jinja templates using custom formatting. Notably, I displayed them in scientific notation. This ensured consistent and readable outputs without excess digits.<br>
I learned the importance of precision in financial applications and refined my skills in data presentation and template rendering with Jinja. #memecoins
