# Cryptofolio
#### Description
Cryptofolio: This is the continuation of my [CS50 2024 Final Project](https://github.com/markoksb/crypto_portfolio).<br>
Cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges makes it challenging to track performance in a unified way. With coins often distributed across different exchanges and wallets, keeping track of them all can be confusing and may lead to missed opportunities.
I aimed to create an app to simplify tracking of cryptocurrencies across various platforms by aggregating data and providing real-time insights.<br>
For that reason, one can create multiple independent portfolios and add transactions to them. The app keeps track of profits and losses on a currency, portfolio, and user level.<br>
The app was built using Python, Flask, Jinja, JS, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. Additionally, Bootstrap for responsive design, the login_required decorator to secure access, and SQL wrapper introduced during the CS50 course.
While the initial version focuses on core functionality, future enhancements will include:
* Handling of various APIs and their keys to import data from exchanges.
* Blockchain integration to track non-exchange assets.
* The ability to conduct transactions right from the app.

These features will be part of future development, enhancing Cryptofolio's value beyond CS50.

#### Installation
Follow these steps to install the app on your device. Keep in mind that you will need an API key from [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com). Currently you can test the app as is on my [server](https://cf.starlight.berlin).
```
git clone https://github.com/markoksb/cryptofolio.git           # clone the repository
cd cryptofolio                                                  # change to the new directory
python3 -m venv venv                                            # create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate                                        # activate the environment
pip install -r requirements.txt                                 # install the project dependencies
echo "coingecko_api_key = '<your-coingecko-api-key>' > key.py   # add your own api key (as it's not provided)
python3 app.py                                                  # run the app default run is 127.0.0.1:8080
